Analyze the project and update `README.md` in the project root to accurately reflect the current state of the codebase.

## Steps

1. **Read the existing README**: If `README.md` exists, read it in full so its structure and any hand-written sections
   can be preserved.

2. **Understand the project**:
    - Read `build.gradle.kts`, `settings.gradle.kts`, `package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, or
      whatever build/manifest files exist to identify the project name, language, and dependencies.
    - Glob source files (`src/**/*`, `lib/**/*`, `cmd/**/*`, etc.) to understand the module structure.
    - Read key source files to understand what the project does, its public API, and its main entry points.

3. **Identify sections to include** (include only what is relevant to this project):
    - **Project name and one-line description** — what the project is and what problem it solves.
    - **Features** — bullet list of notable capabilities.
    - **Requirements / Prerequisites** — runtime, SDK, toolchain versions required.
    - **Installation** — steps to install or build the project.
    - **Usage** — how to run the project, including CLI flags or example commands.
    - **Configuration** — environment variables, config files, or flags, if applicable.
    - **API / Public interface** — brief summary of the public API surface, if it is a library.
    - **Project structure** — short description of top-level directories and their purpose.
    - **Running tests** — command to run the test suite.
    - **Contributing** — short contribution guidelines, if the project is open-source or collaborative.
    - **License** — license identifier and file reference, if one exists.

4. **Preserve hand-written content**: Any section in the existing README that cannot be inferred from the codebase
   (e.g., philosophy, roadmap, changelog, badges, screenshots) must be carried over verbatim.

5. **Write the README**: Create or overwrite `README.md` using clean GitHub-flavored Markdown:
    - Use `#` for the project name, `##` for top-level sections.
    - Use fenced code blocks with the appropriate language identifier for all commands and code snippets.
    - Keep language concise and direct — avoid filler phrases like "This project is a …".
    - Do not include sections that are empty or not applicable.

6. **Report**: Tell the user which sections were added, updated, or preserved unchanged.

## Important

- Do not invent features or capabilities that are not present in the source code.
- Do not remove sections that exist in the current README unless they are demonstrably outdated or inaccurate.
- Do not add a "Generated by AI" notice or any similar disclaimer.
- If the project has no source files yet, write a minimal README with just the project name and a placeholder
  description, and tell the user to fill in the details.
